## 💡 Tips for Next Development

### When Adding New Features
1. **Create files in the right folder**:
   - Business logic → `backend/core/`
   - API endpoints → `backend/api/`
   - React components → `frontend/src/components/`
   - API calls → `frontend/src/services/`
   - Helpers → `frontend/src/utils/`

2. **Follow the structure**:
   - Don't create files in wrong places
   - Keep root clean
   - Organize by feature/purpose

3. **Keep it modular**:
   - One file = One responsibility
   - Split large files
   - Reuse components

### When Making Commits
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git add .
git commit -m "Clear, descriptive message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Create PR on GitHub
```

### When Testing
```bash
cd backend && python scripts/test_db.py  # Database
python -m pytest tests/                  # Unit tests
python app.py                           # Run backend

cd frontend && npm test                  # Run tests
npm start                               # Run dev server
```
